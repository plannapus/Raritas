Version 0.8:
- Added scrollers (duh).
- Shift to Python 3.
- Added data on number of tracks in unfinished count files.
- Modified SAC to show track changes and only dots when new species are added.
- Corrected button event handler: no lag anymore, one can now click compulsively without issues.

Version 0.7 (13/07/2018):
- Alt-clicking a button increments by 10 specimens.
- New species are added to the original "taxa file".
- Lists are sorted by name.
- It is now possible to chose not to put up any buttons, in which case the button "sizer" is made to be of size 0.
- Accommodated code so that config file can contain non-ASCII characters.
- Changed behavior of InspectFrame: while we are still in Normal Count Mode, it shows the realtime tally and not just the tally up to the last track change.
- If the user quits with an unsaved count, the software will prompt to save an unfinished count (works by passing around a boolean 'saved' that is turned to True when performing a 'unfinished' or 'finished' save and to False when performing any other action: adding a species, a specimen, a track or switching to rare count mode).

Version 0.6 (12/01/2017):
- Modified output file to comply with SOD-OFF version 2.1.

Version 0.5 (06/12/2016):
- Corrected bug when uploading an unfinished count that was already in Rare Count Mode.
- Corrected discrepancies between Mac and PC ('Inspect entries' is still broken on PC though).
- Modified name of software.
- Added Land Section support.
- Moved Estimated column in the output file to the 'Comment' column.
- Modified output file so that it complies strictly to SOD 2b1 format.

Version 0.4 (05/09/2016):
- Modified output file to follow SOD-OFF version 2b1. Added as comment the number of tracks counted.
- Corrected file path for help file.

Version 0.3 (31/08/2015):
- Added possibility to add a new species during the count.
- Modified behavior of ComboBoxes so that it is possible to click twice in a row on same species.
- Modified aesthetic of ComboBoxes: now uses default size, but relative position of each combobox change dynamically.
- Created function ComputeDiv (used 3 times) to shorten code.
- Program doesn't prompt the user for saving div file after saving main file anymore but does it automatically by appending "Div_" to file name.
- Made the frame stretchable but not shrinkable.

Version 0.2 (27/08/2015):
- Corrected Sizers aesthetic.
- Corrected Bug with "Inspect Entries" (int to float!).
- Corrected Bug with Collector's Curve and Rare Count Mode and thus modified how cumulative diversity is computed.
- Changed the logic of Rare Count Mode: estimated specimens are now added at the end of the track and not at the beginning.
- When saving finished count, if user didn't click on "Next Track" to finish the current track, program does end the track itself.
- The config file is no longer an hidden file.
- Added HTML help file.

Version 0.1 (26/08/2015):
- Simplified clone of BugCountDorina java program with additional capacity of saving/loading unfinished count.
