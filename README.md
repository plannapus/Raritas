# Raritas

Script, along with [softwares](https://github.com/plannapus/Raritas/releases) for Raritas software implementing stratified counting.

To run the script, you will need to have `wxPython` and `matplotlib` installed with your version of python.
If you are using miniconda/anaconda, you will need to use the binary `pythonw` instead of `python` (so that wxPython can work).

RaritasVox is the original Java software, that includes a voice recognition mode. It has been written by Dorina Lenz and Jens Klump.
